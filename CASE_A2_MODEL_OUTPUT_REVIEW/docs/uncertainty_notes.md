# Uncertainty Notes — CASE_A2 RothC Output Review

## Purpose of this Document

This document describes how **uncertainty is identified, framed, and interpreted** in CASE_02.

It supports:
- transparent decision-making
- audit-facing communication
- fitness-for-use evaluation

Uncertainty is treated as a **decision variable**, not a reporting afterthought.

## Types of Uncertainty Considered

### 1. Input Uncertainty
- Initial SOC estimates
- Soil texture classification
- Climate variability
- Management representation

### 2. Parameter Uncertainty
- Decomposition rates
- Carbon input allocation
- Pool turnover dynamics

### 3. Structural Uncertainty
- Simplifications inherent to the model structure
- Omission of certain soil processes
- Fixed pool representations

### 4. Interpretative Uncertainty
- Translation of SOC change into CO₂e
- Aggregation over time
- Use of outputs for verification purposes

## Representation of Uncertainty in This Case

In this case, uncertainty is represented through:
- variability in synthetic time series
- sensitivity analysis on selected parameters
- qualitative assessment of plausibility bounds

No probabilistic credit issuance framework is implemented.

## Key Questions for Decision-Making

When reviewing outputs, the following questions guide decisions:

- Does uncertainty overlap with zero or negative SOC change?
- Are results robust to small perturbations in key parameters?
- Is uncertainty explicitly acknowledged in documentation?
- Can uncertainty be bounded in a way acceptable for reporting?

If the answer to any of these questions is negative, results are **not fit for external use**.

---

## Common Failure Modes

- Treating uncertainty as a statistical formality
- Reporting point estimates without context
- Ignoring uncertainty propagation to aggregated indicators
- Allowing business expectations to override uncertainty signals

---

## Decision Rule Applied

> If uncertainty materially overlaps with zero sequestration,
> results must be downscaled, caveated, or excluded from claims.

This rule is applied conservatively.

---

## Communication of Uncertainty

Uncertainty must be communicated:
- clearly
- explicitly
- without minimisation
- without overstating confidence

Technical precision takes precedence over narrative clarity.

---

## Summary

In verification-driven contexts, uncertainty determines **whether results can be used**, not how impressive they appear.

This case prioritises conservative interpretation over optimistic reporting.
