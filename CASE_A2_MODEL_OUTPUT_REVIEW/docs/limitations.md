# Limitations — CASE_A2 RothC Output Review

## Purpose of this Document

This document records the **known limitations** of CASE_02 to prevent misuse or over-interpretation of results.

It is intended to be read by:
- technical reviewers
- auditors
- verification teams
- decision-makers relying on modelling outputs

---

## Data Limitations

- All datasets are synthetic
- No measured SOC observations are used
- No site-specific information is represented
- Spatial variability is not modelled

As a result, outputs are **illustrative only**.

---

## Model Limitations

- RothC simplifies complex soil processes
- Pool structures are fixed and abstract
- Management effects are parameterised, not observed
- Certain feedbacks and non-linearities are not represented

These limitations are inherent to the modelling approach.

---

## Methodological Limitations

- No independent validation against field data
- No cross-model comparison
- No ensemble modelling
- Limited exploration of extreme scenarios

This case focuses on output review, not model performance benchmarking.

---

## Interpretation Limitations

- Results cannot support carbon credit issuance
- Results cannot be used for financial decision-making
- Results cannot be generalised to specific regions or systems
- Aggregate indicators may mask underlying variability

Any such use would be inappropriate.

---

## Scope Limitations

This case does not address:
- additionality assessment
- permanence or leakage
- methodological compliance with specific standards
- project-level MRV system design

---

## Risk of Misuse

Potential misuse includes:
- interpreting synthetic results as empirical evidence
- extracting numerical values without uncertainty context
- using outputs in external communications

Such uses are explicitly discouraged.

---

## Summary

CASE_02 demonstrates **how to review and reason about model outputs**, not how to deploy models operationally.

Limitations are documented to preserve scientific integrity and audit defensibility.
