# AgriSystems — Applied Case Studies for Agritech Roles

## Overview

This repository is part of the **AgriSystems project**, an applied initiative aimed at **mapping and understanding technical and analytical roles in the agritech sector**, with a specific focus on regenerative agriculture, soil carbon, and verification-driven environments.

AgriSystems uses **case studies** to explore how different agritech roles operate in practice, highlighting:
- real decision-making workflows
- interaction between agronomy, data, and modelling
- uncertainty handling and audit-aware reasoning

The goal is not training or recruitment support, but **making explicit how work is actually done** in technical agritech roles.

## Purpose of the Repository

This repository collects **applied case studies** designed to:

- deconstruct agritech and environmental tech job roles  
- simulate realistic technical workflows  
- document how data and model outputs are reviewed and constrained  
- clarify what makes results *fit for use* in real-world contexts  

Each case is linked to a specific role and focuses on **judgement, assumptions, and limitations**, rather than tool proficiency alone.

## Scope of the Case Studies

The case studies included here focus on:

- agritech and agri-environmental roles in Europe  
- soil carbon and regenerative agriculture contexts  
- modelling output review and interpretation  
- data-informed decision-making under uncertainty  

They do **not** aim to:
- provide generic training material  
- replicate full production pipelines  
- offer site- or project-specific solutions

## Featured Case

### CASE_A2 — Soil Carbon Model Output Review under Uncertainty

An applied case study associated with the role of **Environmental / Soil Carbon Modeller (MMRV)**.

The case demonstrates how to:
- review RothC-consistent soil carbon model outputs  
- assess agronomic plausibility and internal consistency  
- interpret sensitivity and uncertainty  
- apply an audit readiness checklist  
- conclude with explicit fitness-for-use decisions  

The case uses **synthetic data derived from public ranges** and intentionally adopts a conservative stance toward external use.

## Synthetic Data Policy

All datasets used across AgriSystems case studies are **synthetic** or derived representations based on **publicly available data ranges**, including:

- Copernicus / ERA5 (climate statistics)  
- ISRIC SoilGrids (soil properties)  
- FAOSTAT / Eurostat (land use context)  

No real farm data, project data, or proprietary datasets are included.
